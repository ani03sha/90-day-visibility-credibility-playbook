# Project Ideas — 2025 Trends Edition

## Goal

Equip you with **unique, recruiter-impressive project ideas** that are achievable for junior engineers while showcasing
in-demand skills for 2025.

---

## Why This Works

Most freshers build the same apps:

- To-do lists
- Weather checkers
- Basic CRUD blogs

These are **instantly forgettable** to recruiters.  
Instead, we’ll build projects that:

- Solve *current* or *emerging* problems.
- Showcase applied understanding of **2025 tech trends**.
- Have a **clear, unique value proposition** (UVP).
