# 90-Day Visibility & Credibility Playbook for Freshers & Junior Engineers

## 📌 Why This Exists
I’ve been in the industry long enough to watch multiple hiring cycles, booms, and busts.  
The story never changes: when the market tightens, entry-level engineers get hit the hardest.

Right now (2025):
- **Entry-level hiring is at its lowest in years.**
- **AI automation** has eaten away at many “safe” junior tasks.
- Recruiters are flooded with **hundreds of identical résumés** — same skills, same bootcamps, same certifications.

If you’re a fresher, you’re not just competing for a job.  
You’re competing for *attention*. And most of you are invisible.

This playbook fixes that.

## 🎯 What This Playbook Will Do
This is not another “learn DSA and hope” guide.  
This is a **battle plan** for:
- Building **real proof-of-work** that recruiters and hiring managers can’t ignore.
- Becoming **visible in the right circles** — LinkedIn, GitHub, tech communities.
- Networking in a way that **actually gets you referrals**.

It **will not**:
- Guarantee you a job.
- Replace hard skills you must already have.
- Work if you treat it like a side hobby.

If you commit to the 90 days, you will come out with:
- A **signature project** worth showing off.
- A **personal brand** recruiters can find.
- A **network** that knows you exist.

## 🛡 How to Use This Playbook
- Duration: **90 days** (split into 3 phases).
- Time: **10–12 hrs/week** — non-negotiable.
- Output over effort — no one hires you for how “busy” you were.
- Track progress using the provided `/tracking-template`.

## ⚔ The 90-Day Plan

### **Phase 1 – Foundation (Days 1–14)**
**Goal:** Build your visibility infrastructure & focus.

1. **Choose Your Niche**
   - Example: Backend (Java + Spring Boot), Frontend (React + Next.js), AI Tools, Mobile Apps (Flutter).
   - **Why it works:** Specialists get remembered; generalists get ignored.
   - **Done When:** You can explain your focus in **one crisp sentence**.

2. **Set Up Your Visibility Hub**
   - GitHub → Clean public profile, pinned repos.
   - LinkedIn → Headline, about section, niche keywords.
   - Twitter/X → Bio + link to GitHub.
   - Blog → Hashnode/Dev.to linked to GitHub.
   - **Why it works:** You can’t be discovered if you’re invisible.
   - **Done When:** All profiles are live, consistent, and searchable.

3. **Define Your Signature Project**
   - Pick 1 real-world problem to solve over 90 days.
   - **Why it works:** Big enough to impress, small enough to finish.
   - **Done When:** Problem statement + tech stack committed to GitHub.

4. **Post Zero-Day Announcement**
   - Announce your 90-day journey on LinkedIn & Twitter.
   - **Why it works:** Creates accountability + signals ambition.
   - **Done When:** Post is live with project goal & timeline.

### **Phase 2 – Build + Share Loop (Days 15–60)**
**Goal:** Show momentum and skill, not just final results.

1. **Ship Weekly Micro-Features**
   - Break project into features (2–3 days each).

   - **Done When:** 1–2 commits/features pushed weekly.

2. **Post Weekly Learnings**
   - Share a challenge + solution on LinkedIn/Twitter.
   - **Why it works:** Shows problem-solving and communication skills.
   - **Done When:** 1 post/week with ≥200 views.

3. **Write Weekly Blog Posts**
   - 500–800 words explaining a build decision, bug fix, or insight.
   - **Why it works:** Depth and search visibility.
   - **Done When:** 1 blog/week linked to project.

4. **Engage in the Right Circles**
   - Comment on 5–10 relevant posts weekly.
   - **Why it works:** Relationships > cold applications.
   - **Done When:** At least 3 replies/likes from relevant people weekly.

### **Phase 3 – Proof & Amplification (Days 61–90)**
**Goal:** Package your work for maximum recruiter impact.

1. **Polish Your Signature Project**
   - README, screenshots, demo video, live link.
   - **Why it works:** Presentation builds trust.
   - **Done When:** README explains project in <60 seconds.

2. **Build a 2-Page Portfolio**

   - Page 2: Signature project case study + 2 smaller projects.
   - **Why it works:** Easy for recruiters to digest and share.
   - **Done When:** Shareable PDF under 2MB.

3. **Post a 90-Day Recap**

**Execution beats intention.** Start now.
