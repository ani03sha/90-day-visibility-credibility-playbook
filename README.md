# 90-Day Visibility & Credibility Playbook for Freshers & Junior Engineers

## üìå Why This Exists
I've been in the industry long enough to watch multiple hiring cycles, booms, and busts.  
The story never changes: when the market tightens, entry-level engineers get hit the hardest.

Right now (2025):
- **Entry-level hiring is the lowest in years.**
- **AI automation** has eaten away at many "safe" junior tasks.
- Recruiters are flooded with **hundreds of identical r√©sum√©s** ‚Äî same skills, same bootcamps, same certifications.

If you're a fresher, you're not just competing for a job.  
You're competing for *attention*.
And most of you are invisible.

This playbook fixes that.

## üéØ What This Playbook Will Do
This is not another "learn DSA and hope" guide.  
This is a **battle plan** for:
- Building **real proof-of-work** that recruiters and hiring managers can't ignore.
- Becoming **visible in the right circles** ‚Äî LinkedIn, GitHub, tech communities.
- Networking in a way that **actually gets you referrals**.

It **will not**:
- Guarantee you a job.
- Replace hard skills you must already have.
- Work if you treat it like a side hobby.

If you commit to the 90 days, you will come out with:
- A **signature project** worth showing off.
- A **personal brand** recruiters can find.
- A **network** that knows you exist.

## üí° Project Ideas That Actually Matter

**Stuck on what to build?** Check out **[2025 Project Trends](project-ideas/2025-trends.md)** for ideas that recruiters are actually looking for right now.

**The key:** Pick something that solves a real problem, not just another to-do app.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Start

**This playbook assumes you:**
- Can code at a basic level in at least one language

- Are willing to put yourself out there publicly
- Will commit 10+ hours per week for 90 days

**If you're missing any of these, work on them first.**

## üî• Why This Works

Most freshers make these mistakes:
1. **Building in isolation** ‚Üí No one sees your work
2. **Waiting until "ready"** ‚Üí You never feel ready enough
3. **Focusing on perfect code** ‚Üí Ignoring communication and visibility
4. **Applying to hundreds of jobs** ‚Üí Instead of building relationships

This playbook fixes all of that systematically.
