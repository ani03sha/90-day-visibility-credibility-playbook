# Project Polish Checklist

## Goal

Upgrade your project from "it works" to "this is portfolio-ready" so recruiters see it as production-quality.

---

## Why This Matters

- First impressions decide if your GitHub gets a second look.
- Polish signals attention to detail — a trait every senior engineer values.
- In competitive markets, small touches can be the tie-breaker.

## Checklist

### 1. Code Quality

- [ ] Remove unused imports, variables, and files.
- [ ] Add clear comments to complex logic.
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting (Prettier, Black, etc.).
- [ ] Refactor any function over 40–50 lines.

### 2. Documentation

- [ ] Clear README with:
    - What the project does
    - How to run it locally
    - Tech stack used
- [ ] Screenshots or GIFs of the app.
- [ ] Link to live demo (if available).

### 3. Testing

- [ ] At least basic unit tests for core features.
- [ ] Manual test checklist for critical flows.

### 4. UI/UX

- [ ] Consistent spacing, colors, and typography.
- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout.
- [ ] Meaningful error messages (no “Something went wrong”).

### 5. Deployment

- [ ] Live version on a reliable hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.).
- [ ] Custom domain if possible.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Recruiter can understand the project in <2 minutes from the README.
- ✅ Live demo runs without errors.
- ✅ Project looks intentional, not just “hacked together”

**Pro Tip:** Polish is not perfectionism — it’s making sure your project tells a *clear, confident story*.
