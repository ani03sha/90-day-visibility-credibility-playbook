# Outreach Script

## Goal

Proactively connect with recruiters, hiring managers, and industry peers to create opportunities.

---

## Why This Works

- Most opportunities are not posted publicly.
- Cold outreach shows initiative and confidence.
- Structured messages get higher reply rates.

## Template: Recruiter Outreach

```
Hi [Name],

I’ve been following your work at [Company] and saw you’re hiring for [Role].

Over the past 90 days, I’ve built [Project] — a [short description] — and documented the process publicly. You can see
it here: [Portfolio Link].

Given my experience in [Skill/Tech], I believe I could bring value to [Company’s Goal or Product]. Would you be open to
a quick 15-minute chat?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
