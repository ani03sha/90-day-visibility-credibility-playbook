# Portfolio Page Template

## Goal

Showcase your projects in a way that highlights skills, credibility, and personality — all in under 30 seconds.

---

## Why This Works

- Recruiters skim — they won’t dig unless the first impression is strong.
- A structured portfolio makes it easier for them to match you to a role.
- Most developers have GitHub — fewer have a polished *narrative* around it.

## Structure

1. **Intro Section**
    - 2–3 sentences about you.
    - Example:
      > Hi, I am Anirudh — a backend-focused software engineer who loves building distributed systems and making them
      scale. I specialize in Java, Kafka, and Spring Boot.

2. **Featured Projects (3–4 max)**
    - Title + one-line description.
    - Screenshot/GIF.
    - Key tech used.
    - Link to GitHub + Live Demo.
    - *Example:*
      > **Real-time Billing System** — Processes 100M+ daily events with <200 ms latency. **Tech:** Java, Kafka,
      Redis. [GitHub] | [Live Demo]

3. **Skills Snapshot**
    - Group by category:
        - Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Kafka

        - Infra: Docker, AWS, CI/CD

4. **About & Contact**
