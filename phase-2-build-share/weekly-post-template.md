# Weekly Project Update Post Template

## Goal

Create a predictable, engaging weekly post that shows progress, builds trust, and attracts recruiters/industry peers
without feeling spammy.

---

## Why This Works

- **Recruiters track consistency** → Your public updates act as proof you can work in sprints and deliver.
- **Audience expects a rhythm** → People are more likely to engage with recurring updates.
- **Easier to recall you** → In hiring discussions, a consistent builder stays top-of-mind.

## Structure: The 5-Part Formula

1. **Hook (1–2 sentences)**
    - Start with something that makes people stop scrolling.
    - Examples:
        - *"Week 3 of my 90-day public building challenge — this week I tackled something tricky: AI-driven budget
          suggestions."*
        - *"Small win this week: I finally cracked the problem of smooth chart animations in my finance app."*

2. **What You Built (2–4 bullet points)**
    - Keep it clear, jargon-light, outcome-focused.
    - *"Implemented secure JWT authentication to protect user data"*
    - *"Optimized DB queries — 40% faster load time on dashboard"*

3. **Why It Matters (1–2 sentences)**
    - Tie your work to real-world impact.
    - *"Security is critical because most finance apps fail when handling sensitive data. I wanted mine
      production-ready."*

4. **Demo or Visual**
    - Short GIF/video (30–60s)
    - Before/After screenshots
    - Link to GitHub commit or PR

5. **Engagement Trigger**
    - Invite feedback/questions.
    - *"If you’ve built something similar, how did you handle edge cases?"*
    - *"Any tips for improving chart load speed?"*

## Best Practices

- Use a **consistent hashtag** for your challenge (#90DayDevChallenge, #BuildInPublic).
- Tag relevant people/companies/tools you used.
- Post on **Saturday morning or Wednesday afternoon** (higher engagement windows).

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Weekly post without fail for 6+ weeks.
- ✅ Engagement grows >20% after 3rd post.
- ✅ At least 2 inbound messages from recruiters or peers by end of Phase 2.

**Pro Tip:** Your posts are not for *showing off*, they’re for *showing progress*. Humility + consistency wins.
