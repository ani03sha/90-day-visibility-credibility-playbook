# Technical Blog Post Template

## Goal

Transform your micro-feature or project work into a high-value technical article that builds credibility and SEO
footprint.

## Why This Works

- **Recruiters Google you** → Blog posts show depth of thinking, not just coding ability.
- **Companies value communication** → If you can explain it clearly, you can likely build it clearly.
- **SEO compound effect** → Each post increases the chance you’ll be found organically.

## Structure: The 6-Section Framework

1. **Clear Title**
    - Problem + Result format works best.
    - *"How I Reduced Dashboard Load Time by 40% in React"*
    - *"Building AI Budget Suggestions in Python: From Idea to Working Feature"*

2. **Context (2–3 sentences)**
    - Set the scene: why you worked on this feature/project.

3. **Problem Statement**
    - Define the problem in simple terms.
    - *"Users were dropping off because the dashboard took 5+ seconds to load."*

4. **Solution Approach**
    - List your steps with reasoning.
    - Include diagrams/screenshots.

5. **Key Learnings**
    - Share 2–3 technical or non-technical takeaways.

6. **Next Steps / Call to Action**
    - Link to repo, ask for code review, or propose improvements.

## Writing Tips

- Keep paragraphs short (2–3 sentences max).
- Use code snippets sparingly — only where it clarifies.
- Add **before/after benchmarks** if applicable.

## Publishing Flow

1. Write in Google Docs/Notion.
2. Proofread for typos and clarity.
3. Publish on:
    - [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com)
    - [Dev.to](https://dev.to)
    - Your personal site (if any)
4. Share the link on LinkedIn/Twitter with a short teaser.
