# Engagement Playbook

## Goal

Turn passive scrolling into active relationship-building with developers, hiring managers, and recruiters.

---

## Why This Works

- **Relationships > Résumés** → Jobs often go to people who were *already known* before the opening.
- **Platform algorithms** reward active engagers — you’ll show up more in feeds.
- **Genuine comments** create openings for deeper conversation.

---

## Daily 20-Minute Routine

1. **Morning Scan (5 min)**
    - Check LinkedIn/Twitter feeds for relevant posts in your niche.
    - Save at least two posts for thoughtful commenting later.

2. **Thoughtful Commenting (10 min)**
    - Add value:
        - Share a relevant resource.
        - Provide an alternative approach.
        - Ask a genuine follow-up question.
    - Avoid “Great post!” spam.

3. **Reply to All Engagement (5 min)**
    - Thank people who comment on your posts.
    - Continue the conversation with a follow-up question.

## Weekly Relationship Boosters

- DM 1–2 people you engaged with heavily that week.
    - *"Hey, I saw your post on scaling APIs — I learned a lot. Here’s a project I’m working on where I’m applying
      similar concepts."*
- Join 1–2 niche communities (Discord, Slack, Reddit).

---

## Rules of Thumb

- Quality beats quantity — three strong comments > 20 empty ones.
- Keep tone respectful even when disagreeing.
- Always link value back to what you’re building.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 10+ meaningful comments/week.
- ✅ 5+ new relevant connections/week.
- ✅ one inbound recruiter or industry DM by the end of Phase 2.

**Pro Tip:** Treat comments like mini blog posts — your goal is to make people curious enough to click your profile.
