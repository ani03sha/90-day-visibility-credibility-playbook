# Phase 1: Profile Setup  
**Goal:** Build a professional, recruiter-ready LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter/X profile in **3 days**.  
This is your *first impression layer* — 80% of recruiters will check this before even deciding to talk to you.  

---

## Day 1: LinkedIn Optimization

### 1. Headline
**Format:**  
`Aspiring Backend Engineer | Built [X] | Learning [Y] | Open to Opportunities`  

**Example:**  
`Backend Engineer | Built an API handling 50k req/day | Learning Distributed Systems | Open to Backend Roles`

**Why it works:**  
Recruiters scan headlines in seconds — this puts **skill + proof + current focus** in one glance.

**Success Criteria:**  
- A stranger instantly understands your skill focus and one credibility point.
- No fluff words like *“passionate”* without proof.

---

### 2. Summary (About Section)
**Structure (150–250 words):**
1. **Opening:** Your passion + focus area.  
2. **Proof:** 1–2 notable projects with concrete metrics.  
3. **Current Focus:** What you’re learning/building right now.  
4. **CTA:** What opportunities you’re looking for.

**Example:**
> I’m a backend-focused engineer interested in building high-performance systems.  
> Recently, I built an API that processed 50k+ requests/day for a mock e-commerce platform, optimized with caching and async processing.  
> Currently, I’m exploring distributed system design and scalability patterns.  
> I’m looking for opportunities to contribute to backend-heavy teams where performance and reliability matter.

**Why it works:**  
Metrics turn claims into proof. The CTA tells the reader exactly how to help you.

**Success Criteria:**  
- Has at least one **metric-based achievement**.  
- No generic buzzwords without examples.  
- Ends with a clear “looking for…” statement.

---

### 3. Featured Section
Add **3 featured links**:
1. Signature Project (GitHub)  
2. Technical Blog Post (if any)  
3. Portfolio / Personal Website

**Why it works:**  
Visual links give recruiters *instant click targets* to see proof of work.

**Success Criteria:**  
- All links are working and look professional.  
- No broken images or “empty” repos.

---

## Day 2: GitHub Optimization

### 1. Profile README
Create a profile README with:
- A short intro (“Hi, I’m [Name]”)  
- Skills (languages, frameworks, tools)  
- Currently working on…  
- Contact info  
- Fun fact / personality touch

**Why it works:**  
Gives personality + professional context in one place.

**Success Criteria:**  
- README is under 200 words.  
- Includes at least one clickable link to a project.

---

### 2. Pinned Repositories
Pin exactly **3 repos**:
1. **Signature Project** — large, impressive, solves a real problem.  
2. **Utility/Tool** — small but shows coding craftsmanship.  
3. **Learning Repo** — e.g., daily coding challenges or experiment logs.

**Why it works:**  
Shows **breadth (variety)** and **depth (one standout project)**.

**Success Criteria:**  
- All repos have clean README files with screenshots/demo links.  
- Commit history shows **active contributions** (not all dumped in one day).

---

## Day 3: Twitter/X Setup

### 1. Bio
**Format:**  
`Building in public → [Niche/Focus] | Sharing code & learnings daily | #100DaysOfCode`

**Example:**  
`Building in public → Backend Projects | Sharing code & learnings daily | #100DaysOfCode`

**Why it works:**  
Signals activity + focus — makes people want to follow.

**Success Criteria:**  
- Clearly states your focus area.  
- Implies consistency (daily/weekly sharing).

---

### 2. First Tweet
Post your first tweet to kick off visibility:  
> “Starting my #100DaysOfCode journey today. Will be building a backend-heavy project over the next 90 days & sharing progress daily. Day 1 → Setting up my GitHub profile and pinning my signature project. 🚀”

**Why it works:**  
Sets public accountability — increases the chance you’ll stick with it.

**Success Criteria:**  
- Tweet includes a **specific action** (not vague goals).  
- Tagged with a discoverable hashtag.

---

## Final Checklist
- [ ] LinkedIn headline, summary, and featured section complete  
- [ ] GitHub README and 3 pinned repos in place  
- [ ] Twitter/X bio optimized + first tweet posted  

**Tip:** Keep all 3 profiles **visually consistent** — same profile photo, similar bio wording. This builds trust and recognition.
