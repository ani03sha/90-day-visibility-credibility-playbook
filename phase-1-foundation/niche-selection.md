# Phase 1: Choose Your Niche
**Goal:** Pick a technical focus area where you can stand out and build credibility within 90 days.  
**Timebox:** 1–2 days (don’t overthink this — speed beats perfection here).  

---

## Step 1: Understand the Market
**Action:**
- Look at **20 recent job postings** for entry/junior roles (LinkedIn, Wellfound, Hirect, Naukri).
- Note:
  - Top 3 skills mentioned repeatedly.
  - Domains hiring most (Backend, Frontend, AI, DevOps, Mobile).
  - Any “bonus” skills that stand out.

**Why it works:**  
This ensures you’re aligning your work with **demand, not guesswork**.

**Success Criteria:**
- Have a shortlist of 2–3 high-demand skill areas in your notes.
- Can explain *why* you picked each.

## Step 2: Self-Skill Audit
**Action:**
- List **skills you already know** (frameworks, languages, concepts).
- Rate each from 1–5 for:
  - **Confidence** (how well you know it)
  - **Enjoyment** (how much you like it)

**Why it works:**  
You’ll stick longer with something you enjoy **and** that’s marketable.

**Success Criteria:**
- One skill area scores ≥ 4 in **both** Confidence and Enjoyment.

## Step 3: Pick a Core Niche + Side Flavor
**Action:**
- Choose **one core niche** (e.g., Backend APIs, Frontend UI/UX, ML Models, Cloud Infra).
- Add **one differentiator** — something less common but relevant.  
  Examples:
  - Backend + Event-Driven Architecture
  - Frontend + Accessibility
  - ML + Model Deployment

**Why it works:**  
Core skill gets you found, differentiator gets you remembered.

**Success Criteria:**
- You can describe your niche in **one sentence**:
  > "I build backend APIs with a focus on high-throughput event-driven systems."

---

## Step 4: Commit Publicly
**Action:**
- Post on LinkedIn/Twitter:  
  > "Over the next 90 days, I’ll focus on [Niche] by building real-world projects, sharing learnings, and publishing code."

**Why it works:**  
Public commitment = accountability + visibility.

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 2 people reply/engage with your post — that’s your first audience base.
