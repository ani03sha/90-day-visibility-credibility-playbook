# Phase 1: Build Your Signature Project
**Goal:** Create one standout project that becomes your "professional calling card".  
**Timeframe:** Start in Week 1, finish MVP in 4–5 weeks.

---

## Step 1: Pick a Problem Worth Solving
**Action:**
- Choose a **real business problem** from:
  - Pain points you’ve faced as a user.
  - Common challenges in your chosen niche (see forums, Reddit, Hacker News).
  - Open-source “good first issues” that could be extended.

**Why it works:**  
Recruiters want projects that *look like work they’d actually hire for*.

**Success Criteria:**
- A non-technical person can say, “Oh, I see why that’s useful.”

---

## Step 2: Define the MVP Scope
**Action:**
- Write down **3–5 core features**.
- Identify **1 stretch goal** for later (optional).

**Why it works:**  
Avoids “endless building” and ensures you can ship quickly.

**Success Criteria:**
- Can explain your MVP in a 30-second pitch.

## Step 3: Add Industry-Like Qualities
**Action:**
- Include at least:
  - **Docs** (README, setup guide)
  - **Tests** (unit + integration if possible)
  - **Deployment** (Docker, CI/CD, or cloud hosting)
  - **Metrics** (logs, monitoring dashboard)

**Why it works:**  
Shows recruiters you understand *engineering beyond just coding*.

**Success Criteria:**
- A recruiter/dev can run your project in ≤ 15 minutes following your docs.

---

## Step 4: Make It Show-Worthy
**Action:**
- Add:
  - Screenshots
  - Demo video (1–2 min Loom recording)
  - Hosted live version (Vercel, Render, AWS Free Tier)

**Why it works:**  
Visuals remove the “imagination gap” — they can see it working.

**Success Criteria:**
- Demo link works on mobile and desktop.
- README is beginner-friendly.

---

## Step 5: Ship + Announce
**Action:**
- Push to GitHub with all assets.
- Post on LinkedIn/Twitter:
  > "Shipped [Project Name] — a [what it does] that [problem it solves]. Built with [stack]. Live demo: [link] | Code: [GitHub]"

**Why it works:**  
Combines visibility + proof of work in a single update.

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 5 people engage with the post.
- One person asks a question or shows interest.
